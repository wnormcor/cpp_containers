C++ containers, easy mode

## Summary

The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. To make sure you understand them, let’s re-implement them!

```
• Implementthefollowingcontainers,andturninthenecessaryfiles<container>.hpp
• You must also provide a main.cpp which tests everything for your evaluations.
• member functions, Non-member and overloads are expected.
• You can use std::allocator if you don’t the member function get_allocator is not expected.
• You must justify your inner data structure for each containers using a simple array for a map is not ok.
• If the container has an iterator system, you must reimplent it.
• You can use https://www.cplusplus.com/ as a reference of what to implement as
it’s easy to see C++98 version.
• https://cppreference.com/ is often more accurate on recent version.
• You cannot implement more public functions than the ones offered in the standard containers. Everything else must be private or protected. Each public function/- variable must be justified.
• For non-member overloads, the keyword friend is allowed. Each use of friend must be justified and will be checked during evaluation.
You must turn in the following containers and their associated functions: • List
• Vector
• Map
• Stack
• Queue
Of course, STL is forbidden. You are however allowed to use the STD library.
